## Introduction
Circle Market is a website where people can quickly sell and buy second-hand items. The website features are simple and easy, but the goal is clear.


## Use Cases and Features

This website has several pages. There would be a search bar on the main page, a list of items with pictures and an introduction to the site. So people can easily search for what they need. Also, there would be a sort option for the list sorted by date, price, and location range. On the log-in page, people can quickly sign in with their Facebook and gmail. For people who want to post their item, there would be a simple form they need to fill out, such as title, category, price, and content. If people want to contact sellers, they can just click the button to create a private chat with sellers, so they don’t have to text or email them.

## How To Use

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Run the app
$ npm start

## Tech Stack and APIs

This software uses the following open source packages:

  <p>• HTML<p>
  <p>• CSS<p>
  <p>• JavaScript<p>
  <p>• React<p>
  <p>• MongoDB<p>
  <p>• Firebase<p>
</p>

## Reflection

This was a 4 week long project built during my first project at BrainStation. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.

One of the main challenges I ran into was creating a private chat and sending same data to MongoDB and Firebase at the same time.This lead me to spend a few days on a research about MongoDB, and Firebase or other third parties.

The technologies implemented in this project are React, JavaScript, CSS, Express, Node.js, MongoDB and Firebase. In the next step I plan to make this site into an application so that it can be used on mobile as well.
